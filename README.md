# Covid cases for any selected country

## Description
The [code](covid.py) asks a user to input a country and retrieves updated covid cases data
using this [covid API](https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API).

Once data has been retrieved, it is stored into a database that keeps updated
data about any country that will have been input by the user.

Included in this project is also a [file](covid_test.py) to test each and every function
that is part of the [covid code](covid.py). Ultimately, this file test will be run each
and every time new changes are pushed to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cbcobashatse/API_Codes).

This repo also contains a folder with old code that was used in the learning of the use of APIs.
